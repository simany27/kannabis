        <h3>Submitting a request for permission to hold and consume medical cannabis</h3>
        <p>As part of the “medicalization” reform, steps have been taken to streamline and speed up the procedure for
            obtaining
            permits for the use of medical cannabis. As part of the reform, part of the administrative procedure was
            transferred to an external company, and a computer program was created that allows direct
            send medical documents to the specialist doctor and the patient. Once verified and approved, patients
            will be able to print the authorization and instructions for obtaining the drug, and contact the pharmacy
            with them for it
            acquisition.<br>

            To obtain permission to hold and consume medical cannabis, patients who meet
            the criteria of Rule 106 - cannabis authorizations can act in one of two ways:</p>
        <h3>1. Through a doctor authorized by the YAKAR Medical Cannabis Department to issue permits during
            visit:</h3>
        <p>
            Patients will be able to contact, for the price of a visit to an external clinic, one of the doctors
            authorized and
            licensed YAKAR (Hebrew) to issue permits for medical cannabis. If the authorized doctor decides
            approve medical cannabis treatment, it will issue a permit directly during the visit (and
            will give “instructions to get” for the pharmacy = “prescription”). Once the authorization is issued,
            patients will be able to
            purchase medical cannabis from one of the licensed pharmacies. Doctors have the right to issue permits in
            public medicine, and are not allowed to issue them during private visits or visits within
            Private medicine services - SHARAP.<br>
            In private medicine, you can apply to YAKAR by submitting the YAKAR online form (Hebrew).
            Cancer patients can receive services at the oncology department of hospitals where such
            possibility.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Submitting a request online by a specialist doctor</h3>
        <p>
            Patients will be able to attend an appointment with a specialist in the relevant medical field. If the
            doctor
            recommends medical cannabis treatment - he must complete an online request form (Hebrew) and
            attach the necessary documents to it when filling out the form - as described in the instructions for
            doctors (Hebrew).
            Please note that only PDF documents can be attached.<br>
            After the visit, and if necessary, patients will be able to submit additional documents using
            a special link that allows you to enter the system. This link will be sent to the patient in a text message
            to the mobile phone specified in the application form. In addition, using this link, patients can
            perform additional actions on the computer system, such as adding a patient representative, or
            change of his data, change of address, etc., without the need for an additional visit to a doctor.<br>

            After YAKAR receives all the necessary documents, the request will be forwarded to a doctor for examination
            at YAKAR,
            having the powers of "manager" under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, and
            solutions.<br>
            Once verified, a permission and / or clarification letter will be sent to the email address,
            specified in the application form, directly to the patient and the attending physician.
